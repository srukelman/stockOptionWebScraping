about each file:
yahoofinancescraper.py:
   this was my first iteration it is just like v2 but a litttle less functionality

yahoofinancescraperv2.py:
  second iteration, same idea as the first, but now it outputs to csv(spreadsheet but can be opened by gnu as well as excel) as well as txt. added a conditional statement to limit options to expiring that week.
  most updates will be to this file not the first iteration cuz this one is just better(built different)
  going to add gui but might make a whole new program for that cuz i like this one how it is

chartopener.py
  i use this to open the charts of the stocks i want to buy options of or have already bought options of. i think the url might only work because of the cookies saved in my browser but it should open the 1 year chart with 50 week and 20 week averages as well as the RSI indicator.
  has gui but gui looks bad(might fix it, might not)
